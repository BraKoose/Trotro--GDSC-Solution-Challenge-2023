#TrotroLive-GDSC-Solution-Challenge-2023

Trotro Live Android Kotlin Jetpack Compose App This is an Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, designed to provide real-time information on the location and status of trotros (public transport buses) in Ghana.

Project Overview The Trotro Live app aims to solve the pain point of passengers who struggle with waiting for long periods at bus stops without any idea of when the next trotro will arrive, leading to delays, frustration and sometimes missed appointments. The app aims to provide real-time information on the location, availability and estimated arrival time of trotros to help passengers better plan their journeys and reduce waiting times.

Current Status The app is currently under development, and we are currently working on the Details Screen. This screen provides more detailed information about a selected trotro, including its route, current location, estimated arrival time, and number of available seats.

Solutions Our solution is to build an easy-to-use and intuitive mobile application that uses real-time GPS tracking and information sharing to help passengers find available trotros quickly and easily.

To achieve this, we are implementing features such as:

Real-time tracking of trotros: This allows users to see the location and availability of trotros on their route, providing real-time updates on their estimated arrival time.

In-app notifications: Users will receive notifications when their selected trotro is approaching, giving them ample time to prepare and be at the bus stop.

Easy-to-use interface: The app has a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to search for their desired route and get real-time information about the available trotros.

Integration with Google Maps: The app integrates with Google Maps to provide users with a detailed map of their route and the location of trotros.

Technologies Used Kotlin: A modern, concise and expressive programming language that is fully interoperable with Java.

Jetpack Compose: A modern toolkit for building native Android UI that is more flexible, declarative, and performant than traditional Android UI.

Android Architecture Components: A collection of libraries that help developers build robust, testable, and maintainable apps.

Firebase: A cloud-based platform that provides developers with a suite of services for building mobile and web applications.

Installation The app will be available for download on the Google Play Store once it is completed.

Contributions We welcome contributions from developers who are interested in helping us improve the app. Please feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue if you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for new features.
